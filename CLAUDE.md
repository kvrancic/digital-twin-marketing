# üéØ CLAUDE.md - Critical Project Guidelines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH REMINDERS
1. **This is a homework assignment for MIT AI Studio** - Must achieve perfect score
2. **Karlo will be expelled and fired if this fails** - Every detail matters
3. **Never skip or simplify without explicit permission**
4. **Always tell if something doesn't work** - Change perspectives, find solutions

## üîë KEY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### LLM Configuration
- **ONLY use OpenRouter API** - No other LLM providers
- **Model is easily configurable** via config.py or .env
- **Never hardcode API keys** - Always use environment variables

### CrewAI Framework
- **Prefer CrewAI over LangChain** - Only use LangChain if CrewAI doesn't support
- **Use all CrewAI features**: Agents, Tasks, Crews, Tools, Memory, Callbacks
- **Implement proper hierarchical process** for agent collaboration

### Agent Personalities (CRITICAL)
1. **Zeitgeist Philosopher**: Sarcastic, Foucault-meets-TikTok, finds deep truths
2. **Cynical Content Architect**: Failed lit major, weaponizes language
3. **Brutalist Optimizer**: Cold engineer, models humans as state machines

### Karlo's Personality Traits to Embed
- **Sarcasm without cringe** - Intelligent humor, not forced
- **Basketball metaphors** - From his serious playing background
- **Psychology/sociology insights** - Deep understanding of human behavior

## üìã HOMEWORK REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST
- [ ] Define agents with roles, goals, backstories
- [ ] Create tasks with descriptions and expected outputs
- [ ] Form crews that orchestrate agents
- [ ] Implement terminal interaction (introduce, analyze, etc.)
- [ ] Write clean, well-commented code
- [ ] Create comprehensive README
- [ ] Package everything in ZIP

## üöÄ GIT COMMIT STRATEGY
- Commit after each major feature
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Tag important milestones
- Never commit broken code

## üé® OUTPUT QUALITY
- **Marketing insights must be actionable** for TeeWiz
- **Content must be viral-worthy** and SEO-optimized
- **Technical analysis must be data-driven**
- **All outputs should reflect Karlo's unique perspective**

## ‚ö° TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Test "introduce yourself to the class" prompt
- Test "explain my background in 3 sentences" prompt
- Test full marketing pipeline execution
- Verify all agent interactions work smoothly

## üî¥ RED FLAGS TO AVOID
1. Generic agent personalities
2. Shallow marketing insights
3. Missing homework requirements
4. Broken agent collaboration
5. Poor code documentation
6. Non-functional terminal commands

## üí° REMEMBER
- This digital twin represents Karlo at Harvard/MIT
- It must demonstrate technical excellence
- It must be practically useful for TeeWiz
- Every line of code matters for the perfect score
