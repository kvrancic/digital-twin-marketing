pdf from root on "Building Your Own Crew AI Agent"

Install CrewAI python package and import it to your code.

In code, define your agent’s role, goal, and tools (for example, can it search the web, summarize text, draft emails).

Give your agent a persona that reflects you—what tasks would it handle on your behalf?

Run your agent with a simple test prompt (for example, “introduce yourself to the class” or “explain my background in 3 sentences”).

Document what worked, what didn’t, and what you learned.
